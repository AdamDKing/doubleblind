# Doubleblind.me

This is the repo for a tool hosted at doubleblind.me that helps users set up double-blinded experiments.
I (Adam) developed this because I thought it'd be neat if it existed, and I didn't find it on the internet.
In the future I'll have more on the project here as well as how to contribute, but for now the site
just lives in an S3 bucket, all deployment is manual, and there aren't any tests.
